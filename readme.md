# Node AYLIEN news API

This is a prototype MEN stack API to connect with the AylienNewsApi News API.

## Getting started

In order to get this program up and running you will need to do several things. First in the command line within the directory type

"npm install"

Then add a .env file and add you credentials from AYLIEN

This Application uses a mongo database to store sentiment data from AYLIEN

In order to make this program run you must have mongodb installed and running before you can run this application.

The name of the local database collection should be aylienapi after you have the application running and have posted a entry.

"node server.js" or use "nodemon" in the root

Go to localhost:3000 in the browser

## Making API Calls

This API has three RESTful routes set up; GET (all), POST (one), DELETE (one).


## POST

Make a POST call to the deployed API at https://aylienapi.herokuapp.com/sentiments with a company as a string and you get the average positive, neutral and negative sentiment of the most recent 100 articles related to the company.
